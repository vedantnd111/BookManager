# Book Manager
- Android app that can store books and learnings from it.

## Plan

### 1st tab - Home page:

- should show all the books of the user.
- Each item will be a card and in top-right corner there should be status (Started, In progress, Completed).
- On the home page show - thumbnail, name, author, category, description (truncated) and status.
- Add a floating button on home page - which will be able to add new books.
- Each item should contains swipe functionality to delete that perticular item.

### 2nd tab - Explore:

- In this tab there should be all the books fetched from a public API.
- Card of an item would be similar as one in Home page.
- For each item add swipe action.
- On swipping left on an item here, it should be added in My Books and on swiping right should be added in wishlist.

### 3rd tab - Wishlist:

- Show all wishlisted books.

### 4th tab - My profile:

- In this page user will be able to see his profile pic and personal details.

## General Details

- All pages except 4th one (My profile) should contain a filter based on book category.
